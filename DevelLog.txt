version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v3.1
date: 2016.3.7
1. ClassSolverRt: full calibration and ground plane calibration

version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v3.0
date: 2016.2.29
1. ClassSolverRt: unstable.

version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v2.5
date: 2016.1.21
1. Jacobian matrix in ClassSolver.CostLocalLoopOpt and ClassSolver.CostLocalOpt.

version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v2.4
date: 2016.1.19
1. new function ClassSolver.SolveLocalLoopOpt: solve local optimization consider loop closure info, but without SLAM.

version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v2.3
date: 2016.1.18
1. fix bug in ClassSolver.CostJointOpt, wrong order of output in odometry part.
2. delete artificial error in simulator, replace by ClassSimulator.AddNoise2Rec to impose error on an ideal rec file.

version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v2.2
date: 2016.1.15
1. new member variable ClassSimlator.stdErrRatioOdoLin and ClassSimlator.stdErrRatioOdoRot, norm distribution error of odometry in simulator.

version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v2.1
date: 2016.1.12
1. new class ClassSimlator finished: for simulation and generate record file
2. try main_calib on record data from simulator, drop into local minimum, related with the initial guess.
3. new member function ClassSimlator.SolveLocalOpt, full calibration with local info, good performance with simulator data.

version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v1.2
date: 2016.1.10
1. ClassMap.DrawWithMeasure: show results including trajectory, mark, and mark observation projection.

version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v1.1
date: 2016.1.8
1. finish four class: ClassCalib, ClassMap, ClassMeasure, ClassSolver
2. calibration realized, but weak accuracy and efficiency.

version: simcalibmap3d-matlab-v0.2
date: 2016.1.7
1. calibration and mapping by lsqnonlin finished
2. add mat_std for each mark observation, set by user, larger in depth direction
